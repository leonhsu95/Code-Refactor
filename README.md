# <Horiseon_Mockup>

## Description

This project is built for Horiseon (client) to achieve better SEO. The website, although functional, does not meet web accessibility standards, hindering their searchability on search engines as 'div' containers primarily make up the webpage. This issue was solved by not just adding descriptive 'meta' tags that adds search result description, keywords, and search engine robots but by changing the 'div' containers into more helpful Semantic Elements such as 'Header', 'Main' and 'Footer' tags.

Interestingly, rewriting specific class names to id names in important Semantic Elements not only organises and consolidates CSS respective to its HTML structure, it also increases SEO visibility.
